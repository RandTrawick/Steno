## Dictionaries

My steno dictionaries for [Plover steno](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover)

- Code dictionaries:
  - Assumes the IDE does end bracket completion as in IDEs like [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
    - Might work in VS code, but I only use VS code for java debugging, as the java debuggers for sublime [are not great](https://packagecontrol.io/search/Java%20debug).
  - Assumes the use of [Ctrl-D](https://docs.sublimetext.io/guide/usage/editing.html) for selecting the whole variable word and multiple instances of word in the code file.
    - This is why there are some preset variable names. So there's something there to select and mod.
    - The variable names are randomly chosen for fun.
- teds_cleaned - [An old version of Ted's dictionary](https://github.com/morinted/steno_dictionary)
  - I use this because Ted already has many of the Canadianisms and places.
  - Plus, Ted is amazing! It was through his blogged journey of learning steno that prompted me to take the plunge and learn steno.
  - cleaned to remove his names, and other things.
- my_custom - personal steno briefs
