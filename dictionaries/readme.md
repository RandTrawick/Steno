## Dictionaries

My steno dictionaries for [Plover steno](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover)

* teds_cleaned - [An old version of Ted's dictionary](https://github.com/morinted/steno_dictionary)
  * I use this because Ted already has many of the Canadianisms and places.  
  * Plus, Ted is amazing! It was through his blogged journey of learning steno that prompted me to take the plunge and learn steno.
  * cleaned to remove his names, and other things.
* my_custom - personal steno briefs
* any code dictionaries assume code completion as in IDEs like sublime
